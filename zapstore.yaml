  🎯 Features:

  • Rate, leave comments, review, and write notes on books, movies, series, games, music, podcasts, and performances

  • Interact through ActivityPub — likes, replies, boosts, and federated activity
  • No central authority — decentralized and privacy-friendly

  🌐 NeoDB & Fediverse:
  NeoDB is part of the Fediverse and uses ActivityPub — meaning you control your data and can connect across different servers (instances).
  **Important:** You will need to sign up on a NeoDB instance (such as neodb.social, eggplant.place, or others) to start using NeoComment.

  🔐 Your Privacy Matters
  • No ads
  • No trackers
  • Your account stays on your chosen NeoDB instance

  NeoComment is the ideal tool for media lovers, reviewers, creators, and curators who want full control in a decentralized ecosystem.
