🌐 NeoDB & Fediverse:
NeoDB is part of the Fediverse and uses ActivityPub — meaning you control your data and can connect across different servers (instances).
<b>Important:</b> You will need to sign up on a NeoDB instance (such as neodb.social, eggplant.place, or others) to start using NeoComment.

🔐 Your Privacy Matters
• No ads

• Your account stays on your chosen NeoDB instance

NeoComment is the ideal tool for media lovers, reviewers, creators, and curators who want full control in a decentralized ecosystem.
